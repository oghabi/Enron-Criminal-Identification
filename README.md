## Enron Criminal Node Identification

Identifying key nodes in a social network is essential for various real applications and is of huge interest to governments around the world. One such application is to assist in legal case investigations by focusing on interrogating the key nodes for efficiency and to extract the most useful information.

In this project, I have constructed various directed weighted networks from the non-anonymized email communications of Enron Corporation to be able to identify such nodes. Enron was a company which went bankrupt in 2001 due to its fraudulent actions and this led to the investigation and conviction of its executives and employees by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

I demonstrate the potential of quantitative network analysis by using various centrality measures and other metrics in achieving state of the art results in locating key nodes in order to assist legal investigations and interrogations. The results are evaluated by comparing the nodes to the people who were eventually convicted and sentenced at Enron since the list of convicted people was released by the U.S. government


## Dataset

[Enron Email Dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/): As part of the government investigation, the complete email communications and inboxes of 150 employees in Enron were subpoenaed by the U.S. government and was later released to the public

## Results
